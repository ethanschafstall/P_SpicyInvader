# IceScrub
Set of simple HTML/JS pages that help you manage specific aspects of your IceScrum projects in a simplified interface

### Timesheet

This page requires that you activate and use the 'Time Tracking' app in IceScrum.  
It collects tasks data and lets you filter and present it using a pivot table.  
It is mainly meant to produce the 'Journal de travail' of a project

### SprintReview

In other words: it is the agenda of your sprint review!
